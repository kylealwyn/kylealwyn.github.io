## The Problem
Occasionally, my iPhone refuses to find my macbook when attempting to connect with Airdrop. I've searched high and low for a solution, and until recently I have had to restart my computer in order for the two to gracefully connect. Until now...

## The Fix
Wait for it... just open your bluetooth preferences. Click the bluetooth icon on the right side of your Macbook menu bar and select _"Open Bluetooth Preferences"_. Wait for the menu to open, give your phone a couple seconds, and *voila*, connection at long last.
