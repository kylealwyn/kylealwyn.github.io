I am currently enrolled in the California Program for Entrepreneurs, and we recently discussed business plans and models. I figured I would share the business plan outline we received, and also digitize it for myself, since we received a hard copy. As I write my own, I will go through and share my thoughts on how each section should be structured and what key points should be made in each section
